    <h2>I'm Ed Stuckey</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    I'm 31 years old and based in Plymouth, UK. For the past 11 years I've been
    a gas and heating engineer but have decided to make the change in my career
    to become a self-taught software developer.
  </p>
  <p>I'm currently learning through FreeCodeCamp and Harvard's CS50x.</p>
  <p>
    I love problem solving and am passionate about the idea of being able to
    design code and build programs in a clean and efficient manner in regards to
    any clients requirements.
